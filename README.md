## üìπ Video Source Types

The `ReelsPlayer` library supports various video source types. Below is a table summarizing the supported video sources and their usage:

| **Source Type** | **Description**                                             | **Usage Example**                                      |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Raw Resources** | Videos stored in your app‚Äôs `res/raw` directory.          | `videoList = listOf(VideoSource.RawResource(R.raw.video_file))` |
| **Assets**       | Videos included in your app‚Äôs `assets` folder.            | `videoList = listOf(VideoSource.AssetResource("file:///android_asset/video_file.mp4"))` |
| **URLs**         | Videos streamed from external URLs.                        | `videoList = listOf(VideoSource.UrlResource("https://example.com/video.mp4"))` |
| **HLS Media**    | Videos using HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) for adaptive bitrate streaming. | `videoList = listOf(VideoSource.HlsResource("http://streaningvideo.com"))` |

Each video source type can be specified using the `VideoSource` enum, which allows for greater flexibility in how videos are integrated and played in your app.

## üéõ Player Resize Modes

The `PlayerResizeMode` enum class defines how the video should be resized to fit within the player view. Below is a table summarizing each resize mode and its behavior:

| **Resize Mode**    | **Description**                                           | **Usage Example**                                    |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **FIT**            | Scales the video to fit within the player view while maintaining its aspect ratio. The entire video is visible. | `playerResizeMode = PlayerResizeMode.FIT`            |
| **FILL**           | Scales the video to fill the entire player view, potentially cropping parts of the video to maintain aspect ratio. | `playerResizeMode = PlayerResizeMode.FILL`           |
| **ZOOM**           | Scales the video to fill the player view, cropping it if necessary. The video is zoomed in to fill the view completely. | `playerResizeMode = PlayerResizeMode.ZOOM`           |
| **FIXED_WIDTH**    | Resizes the video to a fixed width, maintaining its aspect ratio. The height is adjusted accordingly. | `playerResizeMode = PlayerResizeMode.FIXED_WIDTH`    |
| **FIXED_HEIGHT**   | Resizes the video to a fixed height, maintaining its aspect ratio. The width is adjusted accordingly. | `playerResizeMode = PlayerResizeMode.FIXED_HEIGHT`   |

Select the appropriate resize mode based on how you want the video to fit within the player view while preserving the desired visual effect.

## üé® Video Scaling Modes

The `VideoScalingMode` enum class defines how the video should be scaled to fit within the player view. Below is a table summarizing each scaling mode and its behavior:

| **Scaling Mode**        | **Description**                                           | **Usage Example**                                      |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **DEFAULT**             | Uses the default scaling behavior. Typically, this mode preserves the video‚Äôs aspect ratio without additional scaling adjustments. | `videoScalingMode = VideoScalingMode.DEFAULT`         |
| **FIT**                 | Scales the video to fit within the player view while maintaining its aspect ratio. The entire video is visible. | `videoScalingMode = VideoScalingMode.FIT`             |
| **FIT_WITH_CROPPING**   | Scales the video to fit within the player view while maintaining its aspect ratio. The video may be cropped to fit the view completely. | `videoScalingMode = VideoScalingMode.FIT_WITH_CROPPING` |

Choose the appropriate scaling mode to control how the video is displayed within the player view, considering aspects like visibility and cropping.

## üì∏ Thumbnail Display Modes

The `ThumbnailDisplayMode` enum class defines how thumbnails should be displayed in the player view. Below is a table summarizing each display mode and its behavior:

| **Display Mode** | **Description**                                           | **Usage Example**                                    |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **OFF**          | Disables thumbnail display. No thumbnails will be shown. | `thumbnailDisplayMode = ThumbnailDisplayMode.OFF`   |
| **FIT**          | Scales the thumbnail to fit within the player view while maintaining its aspect ratio. The entire thumbnail is visible. | `thumbnailDisplayMode = ThumbnailDisplayMode.FIT`   |
| **FILL**         | Scales the thumbnail to fill the entire player view, potentially cropping parts of the thumbnail to maintain aspect ratio. | `thumbnailDisplayMode = ThumbnailDisplayMode.FILL`  |

Select the appropriate thumbnail display mode based on how you want thumbnails to appear in the player view.

## üîÅ Repeat Modes

The `RepeatMode` enum class defines how videos should be repeated during playback. Below is a table summarizing each repeat mode and its behavior:

| **Repeat Mode** | **Description**                                                        | **Usage Example**                                   |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **CURRENT**     | Repeats the current video. When the video finishes, it starts over from the beginning. | `repeatMode = RepeatMode.CURRENT`                   |
| **ALL**         | Plays all videos in the list sequentially and repeats from the beginning when the end is reached. | `repeatMode = RepeatMode.ALL`                       |

Choose the appropriate repeat mode to control how the videos are replayed during playback.
